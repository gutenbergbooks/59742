<h3>INTRODUCTORY LETTER<br />
TO<br />
JOHN RANSOME, THE AMERICAN POET.</h3>

<p class="noindent">My dear Ransome,</p>

<p>Will you accept the dedication of this poem which
seems naturally yours? It was more than a year writing
without losing much of the excitement of the original
scheme, but when on the cooling of inspiration constructional
flaws appeared, these proved to be beyond
help of riveting and surface tinkering, so the edition
is small and very few review copies will go out. Still
the poem is a necessary signpost to those friends of
mine who have found the change between the two
halves of my recent collection of lyrics, <i>Whipperginny</i>,
inexplicably abrupt: and though dissatisfied
I am not ashamed. It would be as well, from other
considerations altogether, not to let the honest
burghers of Nashville, Tenn., already scandalized
by your <i>Poems about God</i>, see a copy of the <i>Feather-bed</i>:
but if this should happen and they demand an
explanation, tell them that I have no anticonstitutional
intentions. Explain that it is a study of a fatigued
mind in a fatigued body and under the stress
of an abnormal conflict, that they can read it, if they will,
as a cautionary tale after the style of John Bunyan’s
unregenerate <i>Mr Badman</i>, only that Badman was unregenerate
(wasn’t he?) to the last, while I leave my
young man in the throes of nightmare. Assure them
that neither does the author nor in a more normal mood
would the hero of the poem himself imagine convent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
life to be what it here seems to be; but that the staggering
rebuff to the young man’s typical bullying attitude
in love leads him to invent this monstrous libel in
compensation; which libel is merely flattery to his own
wounded pride.</p>

<p>The psychological interest of the piece for me, now I
have finished, is in the way that the logical argument broken
by circlings of associative thought, all however relevant
to the emotional disturbance, is continually being
caught up again with an effort by the drowsy intellect.
When at last the sour grapes idea, with its accompanying
fantastics, has determined a reasonable and apparently
final decision of rupture both with the girl herself and
with the traditional religion she represents, the effort
relaxes and the mind is overborne in sleep by nightmares,
its revolutionary enthusiasm flattened by the reaction
of tradition. The Morning Star theme is an
interpolation by the outside Orator to stabilize the drama
which without some such solution comes dangerously
near a manifesto of atheism.</p>

<p>When you visit us in England I want to talk to you
about Lucifer and explain how I had been reading the
Old and New Testaments while writing this poem. Briefly
in this way, as a record of the progressive understanding
of God throughout the ages by a single representative
race, the Jews. God is presented in three degrees at least.
There is God the creator of the race of man, but of man
still animal of the animals, whose daughters the sons of
Adam found fair; let us call that God, Saturn. Then there
is Jehovah or Jove, Saturn’s successor: the Garden of Eden
is the perfect symbolic expression of the birth of Jehovah.
It is more than a fable of the dawn of sex consciousness,
it dramatizes man’s recognition of the end of a
long biological phase, and the birth pangs of the new experimental
period called civilization. The old heritage of
self-seeking instinct, in conflict with a new principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
social order found necessary for the further survival of
the race, split the primitive idea of God into two, the
ideas of Good and Evil, Good being the approval by the
social mind of those non-conscious workings of the body
which further its aims, Evil being the condemnation of
the old Adam inclinations which run counter to it. This
idea of Good then is Jehovah, the God of the present,
predominantly male, violent, blundering, deceitful, with
great insistence on uniformity of rites duties and taboos,
at whatever cost to the individual; Jehovah’s greatest
champion I found in Moses.</p>

<p>Finally there is Lucifer, the God of the future, only
a weakling as yet, the hope of eventual adjustment between
ancient habits and present needs. As the spirit
of reconciliation, Lucifer puts out of date the negative
virtue of Good fighting with Evil, and proposes an Absolute
Good which we can now conceive of as Peace.</p>

<p>The doctrine of mutual responsibility for error, and
of mutual respect between individuals, sexes, classes,
groups, and nations, a higher conception than the eye
for an eye and tooth for a tooth doctrine of Jehovah, is
Lucifer’s. This ideal anarchy is the aspect of God
momentarily seen, I thought, by Jesus Christ, before
him prophesied by Isaiah and before him by Melchizedek;
but since fallen even among Christians under
the renewed tyranny of Jehovah. The story of Lucifer’s
fall is clearly written in the Acts of the Apostles; where
the violence of Moses towards the man who gathered
sticks on the Sabbath Day is worthily imitated by Peter
when he strikes dead Ananias and Sapphira for a partial
witholding of a voluntary gift; where the low cunning
of Jacob with Esau is matched by Paul’s stirring up the
partizanship of Saducee against Pharisee while preaching
the doctrine of tolerance.</p>

<p>This Light-Bringer Lucifer has been persistently misidentified
by the priests of Jehovah with the spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Evil, their God’s arch-enemy. But I would have it put
like this: if John Milton had paused to enquire why Jesus
Christ promised his followers the Morning Star as a
reward for virtue, Milton would have been spared the
compunction which certainly was besetting him in Paradise
Lost for having conceived of his Prince of Darkness
as so much of a gentleman.</p>

<p>One day I must give you the full history of the famous
encounter between the archangel Michael and Lucifer
(outlined in the Epistle of Jude) when Lucifer asked
the riddle still current in English speaking nurseries and
Michael dared not answer or even curse him, because
an open discussion of this particular point might prove
dangerous to the fortunes of Jehovah. In the <i>Revelations</i>
chapter which provides the familiar lesson for All Saints’
Day we hear that Michael had to admit the implied
charge by resorting to violence. But guess the riddle and
you shall have the answer given you; this is the proper
course communication should take between poets.</p>

<p class="center">And so yours in all good will,</p>

<h2>THE FEATHER BED</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Prologue</span></h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In sudden cloud that blotting distance out</div>
<div class="verse">Confused the compass of the traveller’s mind,</div>
<div class="verse">Biassed his course, three times from the hill’s crest</div>
<div class="verse">Trying to descend but with no track to follow,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor visible landmark—three times he had struck</div>
<div class="verse">The same sedged pool of steaming desolation,</div>
<div class="verse">The same black monolith rearing up before it.</div>
<div class="verse">This third time then he paused to recognize</div>
<div class="verse">The <i>Witches’ Cauldron</i> only known before</div>
<div class="verse">By hearsay, fly-like on whose rim he had crawled</div>
<div class="verse">Three times and three times dipped to climb again</div>
<div class="verse">Its uncouth sides, so to go crawling on.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">By falls of scree, moss-mantled slippery rock,</div>
<div class="verse">Wet bracken, drunken gurgling watercourses,</div>
<div class="verse">He escaped limping at last, and broke the circuit</div>
<div class="verse">Travelling down and down; but smooth descent</div>
<div class="verse">Interrupted by new lakes and ridges,</div>
<div class="verse">Sprawling unmortared walls of boulder granite,</div>
<div class="verse">Marshes; one arm hung bruised where he had fallen,</div>
<div class="verse">Blood welled a sticky trickle from his cheek,</div>
<div class="verse">Mist gathering in his eye-brows ran full beads</div>
<div class="verse">Down to his eyes, making them smart and blur.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">At last he blundered on some shepherd’s hut—</div>
<div class="verse">He thought, the hut took pity and appeared—</div>
<div class="verse">With mounds of peat and welcome track of wheels</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Which he now followed to a broad green road</div>
<div class="verse">Running from right to left; but still at fault</div>
<div class="verse">Whether he stood this side or that of the hill,</div>
<div class="verse">The mist being still on all, with little pause</div>
<div class="verse">He chose the easier way, the downward way.</div>
<div class="verse">Legs were dog-tired already, only the road,</div>
<div class="verse">The slow descent with some relief of guidance</div>
<div class="verse">Maintained his shambling five miles to the hour</div>
<div class="verse">Coloured with day dreams. Then a finger post</div>
<div class="verse">Broke through the mist, pointing into his face,</div>
<div class="verse">But when he stopped to read gave him no comfort.</div>
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">Seventeen miles to</span>—somewhere, God knows what!</div>
<div class="verse">The paint was weathered to a mere acrostic</div>
<div class="verse">Which cold unfocussed eyes could never read—</div>
<div class="verse">But jerking a derisive thumb behind it</div>
<div class="verse">Up a rough stream-wet path “<span class="smcap">The Witches’ Cauldron</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span class="smcap">One Mile</span>.” Only a mile</div>
<div class="verse">For two good hours of stumbling steeplechase!</div>
<div class="verse">There was a dead snake by some humorous hand</div>
<div class="verse">Twined on the pointing finger; far away</div>
<div class="verse">A bull roared hoarsely, but all else was mist.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Then anger came upon him, in which heat</div>
<div class="verse">He fell into deep thought and rhymes came strung</div>
<div class="verse">Faster than speech might have kept pace with them.</div>
<div class="verse">The Snake, the Bull!</div>
<div class="verse indent10">What laughter was it, ended</div>
<div class="verse">His allegory and startled the graceful hare</div>
<div class="verse">That secure in the mist came leaping down towards him?</div>
<div class="verse">Witch in disguise, emissary of witches?</div>
<div class="verse">Swiftly he takes a stone up, hurls it at her,</div>
<div class="verse">Chases her, bawling childish angry threats;</div>
<div class="verse">She screams. Now with red shame sorrow floods back</div>
<div class="verse">Making his journey by twice three miles longer</div>
<div class="verse">As though once revisiting the witches,</div>
<div class="verse">Those unclean—it stood symbol in his mind</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<div class="verse">For what, but what? He never wished her harm—</div>
<div class="verse">She being a hare and having innocent eyes—</div>
<div class="verse">It was her fault for blundering on him there.</div>
<div class="verse">He never wished her harm, she should have known</div>
<div class="verse">His angry fit, frustration, weariness</div>
<div class="verse">Breaking a gentler mood. With slackening steps</div>
<div class="verse">He once more takes the homeward road, that is,</div>
<div class="verse">If it does lead home; it’s making uphill now</div>
<div class="verse">And narrowing sadly. That fool finger-post</div>
<div class="verse">Had only snakes to brag about and witches,</div>
<div class="verse">And the bull roared no very helpful threat.</div>
</div>

<h3>THE FEATHER BED</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Goodbye, but now forget all that we were</div>
<div class="verse">Or said, or did to each other, here’s goodbye.</div>
<div class="verse">Send no more letters now, only forget</div>
<div class="verse">We ever met....” and the letter maunders on</div>
<div class="verse">In the unformed uncompromising hand</div>
<div class="verse">That witnesses against her, yet provides</div>
<div class="verse">Extenuation and a grudging praise.</div>
<div class="verse">Rachel to be a nun! Postulate now</div>
<div class="verse">For her noviciate in a red brick convent:</div>
<div class="verse">Praying, studying, wearing uniform,</div>
<div class="verse">She serves the times of a tyrannic bell,</div>
<div class="verse">Rising to praise God in the early hours</div>
<div class="verse">With atmosphere of filters and stone stairs,</div>
<div class="verse">Distemper, crucifixes and red drugget,</div>
<div class="verse">Dusty hot-water pipes, a legacy-library....</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sleep never comes to me so tired as now</div>
<div class="verse">Leg-chafed and footsore with my mind in a blaze</div>
<div class="verse">Troubling this problem over, vexing whether</div>
<div class="verse">To beat Love down with ridicule or instead</div>
<div class="verse">To disregard new soundings and still keep</div>
<div class="verse">The old course by the uncorrected chart,</div>
<div class="verse">(The faithful lover, his unchanging heart)</div>
<div class="verse">Rachel, before goodbye</div>
<div class="verse">Obscures you in your sulky resignation</div>
<div class="verse">Come now and stand out clear in mind’s eye</div>
<div class="verse">Giving account of what you were to me</div>
<div class="verse">And what I was to you and how and why,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Saying after me, if you can say it, “I loved.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Rachel so summoned answers thoughtfully</div>
<div class="verse">But painfully, turning away her head,</div>
<div class="verse">“I lived and thought I loved, for I had gifts</div>
<div class="verse">Of most misleading, more than usual beauty,</div>
<div class="verse">Dark hair, grey eyes, capable fingers, movement</div>
<div class="verse">Graceful and certain; my slow puzzled smile</div>
<div class="verse">Accusing of too much ingenuousness</div>
<div class="verse">Yet offered more than I could hope to achieve,</div>
<div class="verse">And if I thought I loved, no man would doubt it.”</div>
<div class="verse">So speaks the image as I read her mind,</div>
<div class="verse">Or is it my pride speaks on her behalf,</div>
<div class="verse">Ventriloquizing to deceive myself?</div>
<div class="verse">Anger, grief, jealousy, shame confuse the issue,</div>
<div class="verse">Her beauty is a truth I can not blink</div>
<div class="verse">However angry, jealous, sad, ashamed.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Dissolve, image, dissolve!</div>
<div class="verse">Make no appeal to the hunter in my nature,</div>
<div class="verse">Leave me to self-reproach in my own time;</div>
<div class="verse">If I too promised more than you could meet,</div>
<div class="verse">Your beauty overrode my sense of fate</div>
<div class="verse">And fitness, with extravagant pretence.</div>
<div class="verse">Is it true that we were lovers once, or nearly?</div>
<div class="verse">Lovers should sleep together on one pillow</div>
<div class="verse">Clasped in each others arms with lip to lip,</div>
<div class="verse">Their bed should be a masterpiece of ease,</div>
<div class="verse">A mother-of-pearl embrace for its twin pearls.</div>
<div class="verse">But where do you sleep now, and where am I?</div>
<div class="verse">Disdaining all the comforts of old use</div>
<div class="verse">We fall apart, are made ridiculous.</div>
<div class="verse">You in your cell toss miserably enough</div>
<div class="verse">Under thin blankets on a springless couch,</div>
<div class="verse">And I two hundred miles away or further</div>
<div class="verse">Wallow in this feather bed,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<div class="verse">With nothing else to rest my gaze upon</div>
<div class="verse">Than flowery wall-paper, bulging and stained,</div>
<div class="verse">And two stern cardboard signals “<i>God is love</i>,” and</div>
<div class="verse">“<i>I was a stranger and ye took Me in</i>,”</div>
<div class="verse">Ye took me in, took me in, took me in, ...</div>
<div class="verse">The train of my thought straggles, loses touch,</div>
<div class="verse">Piles in confusion, takes the longer road,</div>
<div class="verse">Runs anyhow, heads true only by chance.</div>
<div class="verse">Sacred Carnivals trundle through my mind,</div>
<div class="verse">With Rhyme-compulsion mottoing each waggon.</div>
<div class="verse"><i>God’s Love</i>, <i>the Holy Dove</i>, and <i>Heaven above</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Sin</i>, <i>deadly Sin</i>, <i>Begin</i>, <i>the Fight to Win</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Ye took me in</i>; <i>inn</i>; <i>inn</i>;—and now a jolt</div>
<div class="verse">Returns me consciousness, and weary Logic</div>
<div class="verse">Gathers her snapped threads up. A mouldy inn</div>
<div class="verse">Offensive with cockchafers, sour and musty,</div>
<div class="verse">All night the signboard creaks and the blinds bang,</div>
<div class="verse">The cupboards groan, the draught under the door</div>
<div class="verse">Flurries the carpets of this inn, this inn.</div>
<div class="verse">How I came here? Where else could I be bettered?</div>
<div class="verse">Loneliness drew me here and cloudy weather</div>
<div class="verse">With cold Spring rains to chill me through and through</div>
<div class="verse">Pelting across the mountains, purging away</div>
<div class="verse">Affection for a fault, restoring faith....</div>
<div class="verse">So God is Love? Admitted; still the thought</div>
<div class="verse">Is Dead Sea fruit to angry baffled lovers</div>
<div class="verse">Lying sleepless and alone in double beds,</div>
<div class="verse">Shaken in mind, harassed with hot blood fancies.</div>
<div class="verse">Break the ideal, and the animal’s left</div>
<div class="verse">Which this ideal stood as mask to hide.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the hot blood with no law hindering it</div>
<div class="verse">Drums and buffets suddenly at the heart</div>
<div class="verse">And seeks a vent with what lies first to hand.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But yet no earthbound evil spirit comes</div>
<div class="verse">Taking advantage of my unwrought mind,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Tempting me to a gay concubinage,</div>
<div class="verse">In likeness of some ancient queen of heaven</div>
<div class="verse">Ardent and ever young. The legends say</div>
<div class="verse">They come to hermits so, and holy saints,</div>
<div class="verse">Disguised in a most blinding loveliness;</div>
<div class="verse">Disrobe about the good man’s bed and twitch</div>
<div class="verse">His blankets off and make as if to kiss him</div>
<div class="verse">With sighs of passion irresistibly sweet.</div>
<div class="verse">Yet he has power to turn on them, to cry</div>
<div class="verse">“In the name of Christ begone!” and go they must.</div>
<div class="verse">If I were a hermit now—but being myself</div>
<div class="verse">I never give them challenge, never bend</div>
<div class="verse">Kneeling at my bedside for hours together</div>
<div class="verse">Praying aloud for chastity—that’s the bait</div>
<div class="verse">Certain to draw them from their shadowy caves,</div>
<div class="verse">Their broken shrines and rockbound fastnesses—</div>
<div class="verse">Praying against the World, the Flesh, the Devil,</div>
<div class="verse">But pausing most on Flesh—that praying against,</div>
<div class="verse">Proposing yet denying the fixed wish!</div>
<div class="verse">Closest expressed it’s the most dangerous....</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">How would I <i>say my prayers</i> now, if I tried,</div>
<div class="verse">Using what formula? Would instinct turn</div>
<div class="verse">To</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Gentle Jesus meek and mild</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Look upon thy little child</div>
<div class="verse">To Gentle Jesus and the entrancing picture</div>

<div class="verse">“Bless me, dear God, and make me a good child.”</div>
<div class="verse">Her childishness obscures her womanhood.</div>
<div class="verse">When was I ever conscious in her presence</div>
<div class="verse">That she was bodily formed like other women</div>
<div class="verse">With womb for bearing and with breasts for suckling,</div>
<div class="verse">With power, when she desired, to rouse in me</div>
<div class="verse">By but the slightest art in diminution</div>
<div class="verse">Of her accustomed childish truthfulness,</div>
<div class="verse">A word or gesture hinting doubtfulness,</div>
<div class="verse">The angry stream flooding beyond restraint?</div>
<div class="verse">And yet no frisky wraith has come to-night</div>
<div class="verse">Assuming Rachel’s body, goading me</div>
<div class="verse">With false presentment of her honest person</div>
<div class="verse">To mutiny and to utter overthrow;</div>
<div class="verse">No wanton Venus, no bold Helen of Troy.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For look, a different play performs to-night!</div>
<div class="verse">See how come crowding in, with a bold air</div>
<div class="verse">Of pertinence I do not dare to question</div>
<div class="verse">This odd rag-tag-and-bobtail of lost souls,</div>
<div class="verse">Ecclesiastical, furtive, dim, far gone</div>
<div class="verse">In their <i>dementia praecox</i>! Doctor Hornblow</div>
<div class="verse">On the Pentateuch, Dean Dogma upon Ruth</div>
<div class="verse">(Ay, Ruth; the alien corn was not the worst)</div>
<div class="verse">Keble and Pusey, Moody and Sankey griddling,</div>

<div class="verse">Butterfield with a spotted senior clerk,</div>
<div class="verse">And a long rabble of confusing figures,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Nuns, deacons, theologians, commentators,</div>
<div class="verse">Spikes in birettas, missionaries like apes</div>
<div class="verse">Hairy and chattering, bald; with, everyone,</div>
<div class="verse">A book in the left hand tight clasped, the right</div>
<div class="verse">Free to point scorn.</div>
<div class="verse indent10">My cauliflower-wicked candle</div>
<div class="verse">Gutters and splutters on the chair beside me,</div>
<div class="verse">Over two books and a letter; the crowd passing</div>
<div class="verse">Groans for reproach, confident in their numbers.</div>
<div class="verse">But I, long used to crowds and their cowardly ways,</div>
<div class="verse">Return these insults with the cold set eye</div>
<div class="verse">That break their corporate pride—</div>
<div class="verse indent10">What? those are plays.</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, dramas by John Ford—<i>Love’s Sacrifice</i>,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>The Broken Heart</i>, <i>’Tis Pity she’s a Whore</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">The titles shock? These things are “not convenient?”</div>
<div class="verse">Well, try this other by (ah) Canon Trout,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>The Wisest Course of Love</i>—why do you smile?</div>
<div class="verse">The book of plays I bought, this was a present,</div>
<div class="verse">Sent me with Rachel’s letter—but you smile,</div>
<div class="verse">You’re smiling still? Then I apologize,</div>
<div class="verse">Ladies and Lords. Indeed I never guessed</div>
<div class="verse">Humour was a luxury you admitted.</div>
<div class="verse">“’Tis pity she’s a ... postulant.” Is it that?</div>
<div class="verse">Malicious hearts! but you still nod, laugh, point,</div>
<div class="verse">Pointing what joke? <i>The Wisest Course of Love?</i></div>
<div class="verse">Yes?</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I don’t see. I’ll buy it for a forfeit.</div>
<div class="verse">Then a red-haired beaky-nosed burly nun</div>
<div class="verse">Called Sister Agatha, so I tell myself,</div>
<div class="verse">Comes nearer, throws her veil aside, takes up</div>
<div class="verse">The envelope of the letter. Now she lays</div>
<div class="verse">A manicured finger on the office post-mark,</div>
<div class="verse">Leering down in my face.</div>
<div class="verse indent10">I see it now,</div>
<div class="verse">You ugly she-bear. Wisest Course of Love</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Is <i>Maidenhead</i>? Then you have read the letter?</div>
<div class="verse">Dictated it quite likely? You, then, you!</div>
<div class="verse">I know you, nun-official set to guide</div>
<div class="verse">The postulants through their long penances</div>
<div class="verse">And stern soul-searchings—with the twisted grin</div>
<div class="verse">Of a bawd mistress, none too well concealed,</div>
<div class="verse">You greeted Rachel in the Convent Hall,</div>
<div class="verse">And peered and saw that she was beautiful,</div>
<div class="verse">Giving her welcome with a sisterly kiss.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Mother Superior was quite satisfied</div>
<div class="verse">After inquiry in Burke’s <i>Landed Gentry</i></div>
<div class="verse">That the newcomer was a suitable</div>
<div class="verse">Candidate for the Order of Seven Sorrows.</div>
<div class="verse">It’s <i>so important</i> to have <i>ladies only</i>!</div>
<div class="verse">You twirl dear Mother round a little finger;</div>
<div class="verse">You know her weaknesses, emotionalism,</div>
<div class="verse">Snobbery, love of ritual; quite content</div>
<div class="verse">To let her have her way in formal matters</div>
<div class="verse">If you may mould the spirit of the place</div>
<div class="verse">By due control of youthful aspirants,</div>
<div class="verse">Postulants and novices—with the glow</div>
<div class="verse">Of great devotion, honesty itself,</div>
<div class="verse">You teach them hatred of their woman-flesh</div>
<div class="verse">Eying their bodies with flagellant gaze</div>
<div class="verse">Approving shame’s rebellion. <i>Maidenhead!</i></div>
<div class="verse">A well spiced joke! The carnal maidenhead</div>
<div class="verse">Untaken, but the maidenhead of spirit</div>
<div class="verse">Stolen away. Rachel in your good care!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She says three years’ probation. For three years</div>
<div class="verse">Humiliation, then she takes the veil</div>
<div class="verse">And goes for ever.... “But of course, dear Friend,</div>
<div class="verse">(Where did she learn “Dear Friend?”)</div>
<div class="verse">Should I discover when I search my heart</div>
<div class="verse">That God has sealed me for some other life,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
<div class="verse">That my intended vow of resignation</div>
<div class="verse">Is only pride, why then I’m free again.</div>
<div class="verse">I pray for you,” etc., and etc.</div>
<div class="verse">Dear Friend? lover or nothing it must be.</div>
<div class="verse">I’m tired of friends, I’m past the need of friends.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">We never talked religion till that day.</div>
<div class="verse">I took for granted Rachel used her sense,</div>
<div class="verse">Thought for herself without the aid of priests</div>
<div class="verse">On spiritual matters: I? I never trouble</div>
<div class="verse">About such talk one year’s end to the next,</div>
<div class="verse">But one day argument began; she started</div>
<div class="verse">On Christian meekness, the low slavish virtue</div>
<div class="verse">“Tapeinophrosune”, obsequiousness,</div>
<div class="verse">Which I called nonsense. “Nonsense?” (with wide eyes)</div>
<div class="verse">“Or call it poetry. Christ was never meek.</div>
<div class="verse">Let meekness crawl below in catacombs,</div>
<div class="verse">Pride drives the money-changers with a scourge,</div>
<div class="verse">Keeps silence to accusers, chooses death</div>
<div class="verse">When an escape is more acceptable</div>
<div class="verse">To justice than embarrassment of killing.</div>
<div class="verse">I’m talking paradox? I never meant it.”</div>
<div class="verse">(Here I grew nettled at her wooden look)</div>
<div class="verse">“And as for ‘feeling Jesus in my heart’</div>
<div class="verse">What <i>does</i> that mean? explain!</div>
<div class="verse">I might acknowledge that historically</div>
<div class="verse">All generous action flows from the prime source</div>
<div class="verse">Of Jesus’ teaching (though give Plato credit</div>
<div class="verse">And Aristotle). But Jesus as a power</div>
<div class="verse">Alive, praying, pleading like a ouija spirit,</div>
<div class="verse">Or <i>Laughing Eyes</i> the séance influence,</div>
<div class="verse">That’s stupid and unnecessary, in my mind.</div>
<div class="verse">I am a man, I am proud, Jesus was man and proud;</div>
<div class="verse">He died fulfilling, and his soul found peace.</div>
<div class="verse">I greet him friendly down the gulf of years.”</div>
<div class="verse">“But no!” she said “There <i>is</i> a Spirit of Jesus</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Say what you like, there <i>is</i> a Spirit of Jesus.”</div>
<div class="verse">So I allowed her that, changing my front</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, “If Jesus died on Cross, He’s dead,</div>
<div class="verse">In so far as Mary’s son, the prophet died</div>
<div class="verse">But hardly was He dead,</div>
<div class="verse">Than up this elemental demon sprang</div>
<div class="verse">Assuming mastership of Jesus’ school</div>
<div class="verse">Using his body, even, so it’s told</div>
<div class="verse">Calling himself by name of <i>Jesus Risen</i>.</div>
<div class="verse">Who was he? Some poor godling, fallen through pride</div>
<div class="verse">And greed of human flesh, on evil days.</div>
<div class="verse">He changed his heart and once more stood for power,</div>
<div class="verse">A roaring lion in the white lamb’s fleece,</div>
<div class="verse">So by a long campaign of self-abasement</div>
<div class="verse">And self-effacement grown mob-strong at length</div>
<div class="verse">He overturned high Heaven, now rules the world.</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, he’s a powerful devil; we are his sons</div>
<div class="verse">Got on she-furies of our Northern gales.</div>
<div class="verse">We hate the inheritance entailed on us</div>
<div class="verse">And the outlandish family coat we blazon,</div>
<div class="verse">The tell-tale features also; would deny</div>
<div class="verse">His fatherhood, but for that eye, that nose,</div>
<div class="verse">Betraying Galilee our Father’s land.</div>
<div class="verse">There’s no escape from him. Midwife Tradition</div>
<div class="verse">Has knotted Jesus in our navel strings</div>
<div class="verse">Never to be undone this side the grave.”</div>
<div class="verse">But that was one stage worse than blasphemy.</div>
<div class="verse">And when we parted, she smiled grudgingly.</div>
<div class="verse">I had said too much and cut her to the quick.</div>
<div class="verse">She thought, poor child, she had her choice to make</div>
<div class="verse">Between God’s way and my way. And so she chose ...</div>
<div class="verse">This letter ... But she writes of Christian love.</div>
<div class="verse">What <i>is</i> that? It’s a most annoying habit,</div>
<div class="verse">A warm blood-teasing smile, an open look,</div>
<div class="verse">A recognition—thinks I to myself,</div>
<div class="verse">Boy, this is fine! Love at first sight! True love!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But then the disillusionment—by God</div>
<div class="verse">She turns the same look of those clear kind eyes</div>
<div class="verse">On a bootblack, on some fool behind a counter.</div>
<div class="verse">She calls that, Love? But what <i>is</i> Love to me?</div>
<div class="verse">Love; it’s a two-part game, I’d say, not merely</div>
<div class="verse">The searching radiations from one eye,</div>
<div class="verse">That fly about with indiscriminate force—</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes unthinking in a public place</div>
<div class="verse">I stare at girls sitting sideface to me</div>
<div class="verse">And wonder at their beauty, summing it up,</div>
<div class="verse">Then being innocent girls (I’d never look</div>
<div class="verse">At others so) they grow aware of the heat</div>
<div class="verse">That pours out from my eyes; but do not see me.</div>
<div class="verse">(I may be fifty feet away or more)</div>
<div class="verse">They fidget in their seats, uncross their knees,</div>
<div class="verse">Pull down their skirts to hide even their ankles,</div>
<div class="verse">Blush furiously and gaze about, in trouble;</div>
<div class="verse">Then I start guiltily, rise and walk away;</div>
<div class="verse">But that’s not Love, the searching and the heat;</div>
<div class="verse">Love is an act of God, akin to Faith,</div>
<div class="verse">Call it the union of two prayers by Faith</div>
<div class="verse">(Here we come back to prayer by a long circuit</div>
<div class="verse">And back to “God is Love”)</div>
<div class="verse">But to explain again what’s Faith, what’s prayer,</div>
<div class="verse">That’s the teaser! much too hard for me.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Still, these are not Christian monopolies.</div>
<div class="verse">What’s Faith but power stripped of its ornaments,</div>
<div class="verse">Grants, title-deeds and such like accidentals;</div>
<div class="verse">Force won by disentangling from the mind</div>
<div class="verse">All hampering ties of luxury and tradition,</div>
<div class="verse">Possessions, loyalties and hobby-horses?</div>
<div class="verse">Cast all these overboard, and Faith is left,</div>
<div class="verse">Faith potent through its prayer to miracles,</div>
<div class="verse">Whether in name of Jesus or Jim Crow.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Prayer: Rachel seems to think the collects prayer,</div>
<div class="verse">And Mother Superior, I make no doubt,</div>
<div class="verse">Will teach her scores of neatly turned devotions</div>
<div class="verse">Couched in diminutives and pastoral terms,</div>
<div class="verse">(Lord, how I hate the <i>literary</i> prayer),</div>
<div class="verse">Little white lambs indeed—O baa baa black sheep</div>
<div class="verse">Have you any wool?—And Rachel in return</div>
<div class="verse">Flushing with shame impetuously confesses,</div>
<div class="verse">And holds half back, but crafty eyes are watching</div>
<div class="verse">To drag all out, so Rachel has to tell</div>
<div class="verse">How on the river bank one morning early</div>
<div class="verse">The water was so clear, the sun so warm,</div>
<div class="verse">She kissed me suddenly and was kissed by me—</div>
<div class="verse">Lip kisses, that was all, and fingers clasped.</div>
<div class="verse">Mother Superior then demanding further</div>
<div class="verse">Will cross-examine her on how and why.</div>
<div class="verse">“To tell it now will mortify the passion,</div>
<div class="verse">Then when you make your general confession</div>
<div class="verse">To Father James, your mind will have found peace.”</div>
<div class="verse">(A good excuse) “What then were your sensations,</div>
<div class="verse">The physical joy, tell me, my erring lamb!</div>
<div class="verse">Tell me, I beg, but as the sin was pleasant</div>
<div class="verse">So must confession of the sin be pain....”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Tis pity she’s a whore”. Rachel told all.</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Whore</i>, traitress to the secret rites of love,</div>
<div class="verse">Publisher of the not-communicable.</div>
<div class="verse">If she refused the vows? If her heart changed?</div>
<div class="verse">Rachel and I? This meek ex-novice rifled</div>
<div class="verse">Of her love-secrets? medals and images</div>
<div class="verse">Sewn in her skirts, Birmingham images</div>
<div class="verse">From the totem-factory, niched in her heart?</div>
<div class="verse">No, Love is fusion of Prayer, and prayer must be</div>
<div class="verse">The flash of faith, unformulated words</div>
<div class="verse">Demanding an accomplishment of Love</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<div class="verse">With noise of thunder, against circumstance,</div>
<div class="verse">And Rachel forfeits there all power to love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Who’s this? For now the rabble have passed through,</div>
<div class="verse">Going unnoticed out; Mother Superior</div>
<div class="verse">Secretly with one finger at her lips,</div>
<div class="verse">Re-enters, carefully locks my bedroom door,</div>
<div class="verse">Now she disrobes with fingers trembling so</div>
<div class="verse">They tear the fastenings—naked she steps out</div>
<div class="verse">To practise with her long-past-bearing body</div>
<div class="verse">The wiles of the Earthbound (Ah, the fine young man,</div>
<div class="verse">The hot young man whose kisses tasted sweet</div>
<div class="verse">To our new postulant!) Madam, I beg you!</div>
<div class="verse">You have mistaken the room; no, next door sleeps</div>
<div class="verse">A lusty bagman, he’s the man to embrace you</div>
<div class="verse">And welcome you with every brisk refinement</div>
<div class="verse">Of passion. But while <i>you</i> rumple his sheets,</div>
<div class="verse">The innocent and unhappy eyes of Rachel</div>
<div class="verse">Bewilder me—Oh then in spite of Faith</div>
<div class="verse">I am cast down—You nuns, but if I needed,</div>
<div class="verse">As I no longer need, I’d challenge you</div>
<div class="verse">To contest of hard praying, one against all.</div>
<div class="verse">I could wrest Rachel back even to this bed</div>
<div class="verse">To-night. But Faith, and Prayer that’s born of Faith</div>
<div class="verse">Find her slow mind impediment to their power,</div>
<div class="verse">So I resign her—Agatha, do your worst.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The wisest course of Love? Yes, maidenhead.</div>
<div class="verse">For me? Love’s Sacrifice? It was not love.</div>
<div class="verse">The Broken Heart? Not mine. I’ll say no more</div>
<div class="verse">Than mere <i>goodbye</i>. Go, get you to your nunnery,</div>
<div class="verse">And out the candle! Darkness absolute</div>
<div class="verse">Surrounds me, sleepy mother of good children</div>
<div class="verse">Who drowse and drowse and cry not for the sun,</div>
<div class="verse">Content and wisest of their generation.</div>
</div>
